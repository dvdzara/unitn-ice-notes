title: Typesetting guidelines

Guidelines to write `*.md` or `*.mdx` files in a consistent manner.

## Prose styling

- text inside list items starts with a small letter and ends with a semicolon;
- normal text starts with a capital letter and ends with a dot;

## Math mode styling

- always add a space after a comma inside a math expression;
- use a comma inside a math expression only if required, otherwise, to list
  things, use individual math sections for each element;
- always put a space after and `\exists` tag, like this `'\exists\ '`;
