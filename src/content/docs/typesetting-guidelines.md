Guidelines to write `*.mdx` files in a consistent manner.

## Math mode styling

- always add a space after a comma inside a math expression;
- use a comma inside a math expression only if required, otherwise, to list
  things, use individual math sections for each element;
- always put a space after and `\exists` tag, like this `'\exists\ '`;
